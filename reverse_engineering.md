When I used ```nc mercury.picoctf.net 28067``` in terminal , i got a weird output. Then i saved the output into a text file. Upon seeing this hint 
```What language does a CNC machine use?``` , I found out that this is a G-Code. Upon decoding the output the flag is ```picoCTF{num3r1cal_c0ntr0l_84d2d117}```

For this challenge we are given a Java File. When we open the file we will be able to see the flag for this challenge <br />
The flag is ```picoCTF{w4rm1ng_Up_w1tH_jAv4_be8d9806f18}```

For this challenge we are given a Java File. When we see the file there is a function named ```checkPassword()``` which verifies the user's answer. Looking at the function we can say that the length of flag is 32 and charcters of each index is there in the function. On arranging in the correct order , we get the flag. <br />
The flag is ```picoCTF{d35cr4mbl3_tH3_cH4r4cT3r5_03f841```
