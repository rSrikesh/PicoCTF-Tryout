When I used ```nc mercury.picoctf.net 28067``` in terminal , i got a weird output. Then i saved the output into a text file. Upon seeing this hint 
```What language does a CNC machine use?``` , I found out that this is a G-Code. Upon decoding the output the flag is ```picoCTF{num3r1cal_c0ntr0l_84d2d117}```
